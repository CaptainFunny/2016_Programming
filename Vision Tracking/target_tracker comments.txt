 - RoboRealm target_tracker.robo Comments -
 
1. FRC_CameraClient
	Gets the images off of the RoboRio over the network.
2. Intensity Auto
	Bring the image intensity to a common threshold. This makes tracking in different lighting situations more reliable.
3. Intensity -50
	Lower the image intensity.
4. Contrast -50
	Lower the image contrast.
5. Color Threshold
	Filter out colors to narrow down where the target could be.
6. Blob Filter
	Remove small blobs.
7. Marker
	Set a checkpoint here for use in Math module.
8. Convex Hull
	Fill each blob with its convex.
9. Math Subtract
	Subtract the image from before the Convex Hull module with the image after it. This filters out objects which were already convex.
10. Blob Filter
	 Filter out blobs further to narrow down which could be the target. After filtering, remove all blobs except the largest one.
11. Blob Replace
	 Replace the one blob remaining with a box, and display that box over the source image.
12. Network_Tables
	 Send the blob's coordinates on the screen to the RoboRio.
